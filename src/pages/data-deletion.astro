      <p>
        You can request deletion of your AI Health Coach App account and associated data at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>How to request deletion</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Email us from the address associated with your account at
          <a href="mailto:joseph.toland@teknicalsolutionz.com">joseph.toland@teknicalsolutionz.com</a>
          with the subject line <strong>"Delete my AI Health Coach App account"</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include the email address you use to sign in and any relevant identifiers (if provided in-app).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What we delete</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your account profile (name, email, settings)</li>
        <li>Health and fitness data stored for your account (including Garmin data, if connected)</li>
        <li>Derived analytics and recommendations associated with your account</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Timing</h2>
      <p>
        We typically process deletion requests within 30 days. Certain records may be retained as required by law
        or for security/fraud prevention, and will be deleted when no longer required.
      </p>

      <h2>Disconnecting Garmin</h2>
      <p>
        You can also revoke Garmin access at any time by disconnecting the integration in-app, or by revoking
        access in your Garmin account/consent settings.

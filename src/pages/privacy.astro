      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Teknical Solutionz LLC</strong> ("we", "us") collects, uses, and
        protects information when you use the <strong>AI Health Coach App</strong> and associated services
        (collectively, the "Service").
      </p>

      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information</strong> you provide (e.g., name, email address, basic profile details).</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Health &amp; fitness data</strong> you choose to connect and share from wearable providers
          (e.g., Garmin Connect) and/or manual entries (workouts, sleep, biometrics, notes).
        </li>
        <li><strong>App usage &amp; diagnostics</strong> (e.g., crashes, performance metrics) to improve reliability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we use data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide the Service and the features you request (syncing, dashboards, and insights).</li>
        <li>Generate recommendations and summaries based on your connected data and your inputs.</li>

      <h2>Garmin data usage (high level)</h2>
      <p>
        If you connect Garmin Connect, you explicitly authorize data sharing via OAuth and can revoke access at any

      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We only share data with service providers needed to operate the Service
        (e.g., hosting/analytics) under appropriate contractual protections, or if required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain data as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service. You can request
        deletion at any time (see the Data Deletion page).
      </p>

      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Connect or disconnect data sources at any time.</li>
        <li>Request an export of your data, when available.</li>

and AI-assisted training guidance.

            AI Health Coach App is a modern mobile application designed to unify health and fitness data from wearables,
            manual tracking, and cloud services into a single experience. The app brings workouts, sleep, biometrics, and
            nutrition signals together in one place, then applies AI-driven analysis to generate personalized insights
            and suggested workout plans—helping users train smarter, recover better, and stay consistent.
